A powerful and seamless integration to control your Govee BLE lighting devices
directly from Home Assistant. No bridges or cloud accounts required.
This repository includes the source from the original BLE control repository, as well as patches from [cralex96](https://github.com/cralex96/govee_ble_lights) and [Rombond](https://github.com/Rombond/h617a_govee_ble_lights), credit to them for their work.

Here is a compatibility table of different light models.

| Model | Change Color | Change Brightness | On/Off |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| H617A | ✅           | ✅                | ✅     |
| H617C | ✅           | ✅                | ✅     |
| more..| ✅           | ✅                | ✅     |

## Features

- 🚀 **Direct BLE Control**: No need for middlewares or bridges. Connect and control your Govee devices directly through Bluetooth Low Energy.

- 💡 **Comprehensive Lighting Control**: Adjust brightness, change colors, or switch on/off with ease.

- 🌈 **Effects**: Animated, segment-aware patterns on segmented models.

- ⏱️ **Transitions & Fades**: Smooth crossfades on color changes, plus a per-call `transition` option from automations.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

This integration is **not in the default HACS list yet**, so you need to add it as a custom repository:

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Open the three-dot menu (top right) and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Paste `https://github.com/Laserology/govee_ble_lights` as the repository, choose **Integration** as the category, and click **Add**.
4. Search HACS for **Ultimate Govee BLE Lights** and download it.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/govee-ble-lights` folder into your Home Assistant
`config/custom_components/` directory and restart Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration

### What is needed

For Direct BLE Control:

- Before you begin, make certain Home Assistant can access BLE on your platform. Ensure your Home Assistant instance is granted permissions to utilize the Bluetooth Low Energy of your host machine.

---

## Usage

With the integration installed and Home Assistant restarted, add your light:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for and select **Ultimate Govee BLE Lights**.
3. Choose **BLE** as the configuration type.
4. Select your device and its model.

Devices are discovered over Bluetooth automatically. When a device is added this way, the model is pre-selected from the advertisement name whenever it matches a supported model (e.g. `Govee_H617C_2482`), so you usually only have to confirm.

Each light then appears as an entity you can control (on/off, brightness, color) and use in automations:

- **Effects**: segmented models expose an **Effects** dropdown. Selecting `None` leaves effect mode and repaints the light with the last solid color used, so the pattern is actually cleared.

- **Transitions**: `light.turn_on` / `light.turn_off` accept a `transition` (seconds), e.g.:

  ```yaml
  service: light.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: light.bedroom
  data:
    rgb_color: [255, 0, 0]
    transition: 3
  ```

Each light also reports diagnostic attributes for automations and support:

- `govee_model`, `govee_segments` (segmented models only)
- `govee_rssi` — last seen signal strength
- `govee_last_write_ms` — BLE write latency

The **Download diagnostics** button on the config entry exports the same info.

## Troubleshooting for BLE

If you're facing issues with the integration, consider the following steps:

1. **Check BLE Connection**:

   Ensure that the Govee device is within the Bluetooth range of your Home Assistant host machine.

2. **Model Check**:

   Check that you selected the correct device model.

3. **Logs**:

   Home Assistant logs can provide insights into any issues. Navigate to `Settings > System > Logs` to review any error messages related to the Govee integration.
